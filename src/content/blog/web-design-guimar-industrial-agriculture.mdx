Güímar is not just a town. It is an economic lung of Tenerife.
<br/>
But I see a brutal disconnect: Companies billing millions in the Industrial Park with websites from the 90s (embarrassing, honestly), and farmers with top-quality products who are invisible online.
<br/>
The solution is not hiring a "chic" agency from the Peninsula that can't locate Arafo on a map and charges you the "distance tax". The solution is **Zero Kilometer Engineering**.

    <Heading as="h3" size="xs" class="my-4">Do you have time for meetings in Barcelona?</Heading>
    
    I know how the rhythm works in the Industrial Park. Trucks entering, logistics, stock, rotating shifts. You don't have time to explain to a Project Manager in Madrid what your product is via a pixelated Zoom call that keeps cutting out.

    **My value proposition is face-to-face:**
    * I come to your **office in the warehouse**.
    * I see your process on-site (I'll wear a helmet if needed).
    * We design digital catalogs and B2B systems that work for your sales team, not just "pretty websites" to show the family.

<Heading as="h2" size="sm" class="my-4" gradient>2. 🌿 For the Farmer: From the Farm to the Global Market</Heading>

<Callout type="success" title="Meetings in the Greenhouse">
  The best strategies are not always born in air-conditioned boardrooms. Sometimes they are born between furrows, seeing the real product and getting boots dirty.
</Callout>

The primary sector in Güímar has brutal quality (avocados, wines, bananas...), but zero digital presence. It is no longer enough to sell to the usual wholesaler hoping they pay well.
<br/>
A professional website allows you to:
<br/>
* **Export:** Show quality certifications and traceability to European buyers looking for premium product.
<br/>
* **Direct Sales:** Eliminate intermediaries and improve your margin.
<br/>
* **Image:** Make your farm look like what it really is: a modern and technological agri-food company.

<Heading as="h2" size="sm" class="my-4" gradient>3. 🏪 For Local Commerce: Speed Where Coverage Fails</Heading>

If you have a restaurant in **El Puertito** or a shop/guachinche in **El Escobonal**, you know an uncomfortable truth: 4G coverage sometimes falters.
<br/>
If your website takes 10 seconds to load, the customer closes it and goes to the one next door. It's that simple.

<List variant="check">
  <ListItem title="⚡ Static Technology (Astro)">
    My websites weigh less than a WhatsApp photo. They load instantly even with 3G or unstable coverage in the mid-altitudes. No one will wait for your 10MB PDF menu to load.
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem title="🗺️ Hyper-Local SEO">
    We make Google Maps place you exactly where you are. So when they search "Restaurant in Güímar", you show up, not one in Candelaria or Arafo.
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem title="📱 Real Mobile Optimization">
    90% of your customers search for you from their mobile on the street or at the beach. We design for the thumb, not for the mouse.
  </ListItem>
</List>

<Heading as="h3" size="sm" class="my-4" gradient>4. The Ghost of "Kit Digital" (The Uncomfortable Truth)</Heading>

Note: "Kit Digital" is a specific Spanish subsidy program, so I'll keep the name but explain the context.

Surely you know the story: They called you promising a "free" website with the European subsidy. You signed, they delivered an empty template made in 4 hours, collected the voucher, and... never to be seen again.

The Valley is full of "Zombie Websites" from the Kit Digital.
1. They have no strategy.
2. No one explained how to use them.
3. Now that you want to change a photo, you don't know who to call.
<br/>
I am not a "Digitizing Agent" who hunts subsidies and runs. I am a **Digital Partner**. If we work together, the website is yours, the control is yours, and if there are subsidies, we use them to create real value, not to tick a box.

<Heading as="h3" size="sm" class="my-4" gradient>5. Rural Tourism: Your House, Your Rules (And Your Margins)</Heading>

If you have a rural house in the mid-altitudes or an apartment in El Socorro, I have a painful question for you: **How much money did you give away to Booking or Airbnb last year?**
<br/>
That 15% or 20% commission is money coming out of your pocket.
<br/>
Look, I'm not telling you to leave the platforms (they are a good showcase). I'm telling you that your website must be so good that the customer prefers to book directly with you.

* **Own Booking Engine:** No commissions.
* **Fast Gallery:** Let the sea views and the Barranco de Badajoz be seen without waiting for the photo to load.
* **Loyalty:** Make the returning customer return to you, not to the App.

  It can be in Plaza de San Pedro, in Fátima, in your office at the Industrial Park, or right on the field.
  
  What matters is not where, but **when** we start digitalizing your business seriously.
