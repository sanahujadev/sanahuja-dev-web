The Canary Islands lifestyle is built on a simple premise: **Quality of Life**.
<br/>
Sun, sea, and a relaxed pace. So why is your business website the exact opposite?
<br/>
If your digital presence means constant updates, security scares, and plugins breaking on a Friday night... That's not what you signed up for. You moved here (or started a business here) to live better, not to become a frustrated IT manager.
<br/>

**But wait, it gets worse.**
<br/>

Maybe you aren't just fighting plugins. Maybe your freelancer sold you a "modern" solution that is actually a trap. Did they build a simple corporate site using complex Servers, Databases, and SSR (Server Side Rendering)?
<br/>
Let's be real: **Using a heavy server stack for a brochure website is like buying a Ferrari engine to power a bicycle.**
<br/>
It costs a fortune to maintain, it breaks if you look at it wrong, and it solves a problem you didn't have. Why are you paying monthly server costs and database maintenance for a page that doesn't need to change every second?
<br/>
Let's bring "Silicon Valley" standards to paradise. It's time to stop worrying about your server and start enjoying your business.

    <Heading as="h2" size="sm" class="my-4" gradient>The High Cost of "Cheap" Websites</Heading>
    <Heading as="h3" size="xs" class="my-4">The DIY Trap</Heading>
    Starting with a €50 template seems smart until you realize the hidden costs. It's the classic iceberg illusion. You think you bought a solution, but you actually bought a **second job**.

    Suddenly, you are the Security Officer, the Designer, and the Troubleshooter.

    </List>

    You wanted a business asset. You got a liability.

<Heading as="h3" size="xs" class="my-4">The "Ticket #4920" Nightmare</Heading>
And let's talk about the "Support" provided by giants like Wix, Hostinger, or GoDaddy. Have you ever tried to get urgent help when your site is down on a Saturday?
<br/>
You don't get an engineer. You get a chatbot named "Steve" that sends you generic articles. Or you submit a ticket and wait 48 hours for a reply that says *"Have you tried clearing your cache?"*.
<br/>
In the "Cheap" model, you are just a number in a database. When things break, you are alone.

<Heading as="h3" size="sm" class="my-4" gradient>Built with Silicon Valley Standards</Heading>

We don't just "install themes". We are engineers. We build solutions using the same modern tech stack used by Netflix or Uber, adapted for your business size. No bloatware, just performance.

<List variant="check" class="my-6">
  <ListItem title="The Right Tool for the Job">
    Need a lightning-fast corporate site? We go **Static** (unhackable, instant). Need a complex booking engine? We build a **Custom App**. We don't force you into a box; we build the box you need.
  </ListItem>
  
  <ListItem title="Unbreakable Security">
    Whether it's a Headless CMS or a custom solution, we handle the infrastructure. No more "update panic". We act as your digital firewall.
  </ListItem>
  
  <ListItem title="Speed is Non-Negotiable (WPO)">
    In the era of Core Web Vitals, speed is SEO. We optimize every line of code so Google loves you. If it takes more than 2 seconds, it's too slow.
  </ListItem>
</List>

<Heading as="h3" size="sm" class="my-4" gradient>Rent vs. Own: The Smart Model</Heading>

Here is where we differ from the giants like Wix or Squarespace. We believe in ownership.

<div data-testid="accordion-rent-vs-own">
  <Accordion title="Why not just use Wix or Squarespace?" open>
    **The Renting Trap:** With platforms like Wix, you are a tenant forever. You pay a monthly fee, but you *never* own your site. If you stop paying, they delete everything. You lose your content, your SEO, and your digital existence instantly.
    <br/>
    **Our Hybrid Model (Lease-to-Own):** We operate differently. You pay a managed service fee (which includes a massive discount on creation + hosting + updates + support) for a set period (e.g., 2 years). After that period? **The code is 100% yours.** You are building an asset, not paying a landlord forever. It's an investment in your company's equity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I need to change content?">
    We offer flexibility based on your management style:
    <br/>
    1. **Hands-Off (Hours Bank):** Send us an email or WhatsApp, and we update it professionally. Perfect for busy owners who don't want to touch a computer.
    <br/>
    2. **Hands-On (Headless CMS):** We integrate a modern, secure dashboard where you can edit texts and images easily, without breaking the design.
  </Accordion>
