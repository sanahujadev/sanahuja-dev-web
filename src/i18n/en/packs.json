            "answer": "A traditional website is a product (you pay, you get it, you figure it out). These Packs are a <strong>Comprehensive Service</strong>. Here you don't buy 'code', you hire a Digital Department that works every month so your business has visibility, security, and clients. It's the difference between buying a car and hiring a chauffeur. They also represent guaranteed solutions."

            "question": "Is the website mine or is it a rental?",
            "answer": "<strong>It is a Managed Service with Intellectual Property of SanahujaDev.</strong> At the beginning, I assume the real cost of development (valued at thousands of euros) so that you can enter with a minimal investment. Therefore, the code belongs to me. However, <strong>I believe in long-term relationships</strong>. If after a reasonable period of successful collaboration you decide to go solo, or if your personal situation requires it, we will sit down to assess the transfer of the website. It all depends on our history together. (Note: If you bought the domain, it is always yours; if I paid for it, it is included in the service package)."
          },
          {
            "question": "Is there a lock-in period?",
            "answer": "<strong>There are no slavery contracts, but there is commitment.</strong> You can cancel the service whenever you want; I won't hold you by force. But keep in mind that, being a 'Web as a Service' model, if you cancel the service shortly after starting, the website is deactivated (since the development hasn't been amortized). My goal is for you to stay for years because you are doing well, not because a paper forces you to."
          },
          {
            "question": "What happens if I need changes to the website?",
            "answer": "Maintenance includes technical and security updates so nothing fails. If you need structural design changes or new functions, being a Digital Partner you have preferential rates or we can use an Hours Bank. The Packs cover *operation and growth*, not *continuous redesign*."
